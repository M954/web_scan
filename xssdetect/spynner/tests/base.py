Lot of files generated by the collective.generic packages  will try to load user defined objects in user specific files.
The final goal is to regenerate easyly the test infrastructure on templates updates without impacting
user-specific test boilerplate.
We do not use paster local commands (insert/update) as it cannot determine witch is specific or not and we prefer to totally
separe generated stuff and what is user specific
